# Uniform Game Settings
This project has been created with the sole goal of standardizing video game settings; 
enabling shared accessibility for free, for everyone, forever.

If a system exists that incorporates every possible setting, 
then developers could optionally parse preference files and settings could persist across all games.

Imagine if games didn't need to reply on the devoloper's interpretation of the default for settings.
- Maybe you need/prefer subtitles? This could enable subtitles to always be on by default.
- Maybe you need/prefer the lowest resolution.
- The easiest or hardest difficulty.
- Etc.

It seems unintuitive that a system like this does not already exist.

A base system is in the works and will be published soon, 
however I know it will be missing many options and funtionality 

so I encourage modification but must ask that derivative works are not shared.
An effort must be made towards maintaining a single standard version for everyone to use.

Please help me to improve the system by forking, making needed changes and then submitting a pull request.

I'm happy to cooperate with any authoritative entities looking to help moderate changes.



Thank you for your time.
