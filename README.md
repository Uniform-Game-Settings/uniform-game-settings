# Uniform Game Settings
This project has been created with the sole goal of standardizing video game settings; 
enabling shared accessibility for free, for everyone, forever.

If a system exists that incorporates every possible setting, 
then developers could optionally parse preference files and settings could persist across all games.

I encourage modification but must ask that derivative works are not shared.
An effort must be made towards maintaining a single standard version for everyone to use.

Please help me to improve the system by forking, making needed changes and then submitting a pull request.

I'm happy to cooperate with any authoritative entities looking to help moderate changes.
